automation security scanner for sql injection and xss scanner
Web security is an important aspect for web applications. Today web security is a real concern related to the Internet. It is considered as the principal framework for the worldwide data society. Web applications provide a better interface for a client through a web page. The web page script gets executed on client web browser.
Web applications are a main base of attacks such as cross-site scripting, cookie-session theft, browser attack, self-propagating worms in web email and web sites. These types of attacks are called ‘injection attacks’ which attacks by the use of malicious code. Injection attacks have commanded the highest point of web application vulnerability lists for a significant part of the previous decade.
There are two most common security vulnerabilities today: SQL injection and cross-site scripting. A security evaluation of application defence centre, which had more than 250 e-commerce applications, online banking and the corporate sites came up with a statement that more than 85% of web applications are vulnerable to attacks.
  
## About OWASP 
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organisation dedicated to improving software security. The OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to protect the internet, with community-led open-source software initiatives, many local structures around the world, a vast number of participants, and leading educational and training conferences.

- Collaboration and Networking

- Training & Education 

The Scanner for OWASP vulnerabilities is used to detect the bug and vulnerabilities that the websites display about the kinds of vulnerabilities in them. As we all know, over the last decade, organisations have been affected by an ever-increasing number of status data breaches. A large number of them are so-called "injection attacks," in which malicious code is injected into an online application. Indeed, according to OWASP, a web application security organisation, “How data input is managed by Web applications is arguably the most important aspect of security.”  

## About Project Development 
Python and its various modules are used to develop this project. For the QT front end, it is the latest and most visually attractive python tool. 
### python 
Python is a language of interpretation, high quality and general use. With his remarkable application of important whitespace, Python's design philosophy emphasises code readability. Its language structures and object-oriented approach are aimed at allowing programmers to produce clear and logical code for large and small projects. 
Python is a language of multiple paradigms. Object-oriented and structured programming are fully supported, and several of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented (including metaprogramming and metapointing) programming. Many other paradigms, including contract design and logic programming, are supported through extensions. 
This language has been chosen for its modularity and its easy reading and a vast community of help and support
