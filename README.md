Web security is an important aspect for web applications. Today web security is a real concern related to the Internet. It is considered as the principal framework for the worldwide data society. Web applications provide a better interface for a client through a web page. The web page script gets executed on client web browser.
Web applications are a main base of attacks such as cross-site scripting, cookie-session theft, browser attack, self-propagating worms in web email and web sites. These types of attacks are called ‘injection attacks’ which attacks by the use of malicious code. Injection attacks have commanded the highest point of web application vulnerability lists for a significant part of the previous decade.
There are two most common security vulnerabilities today: SQL injection and cross-site scripting. A security evaluation of application defence centre, which had more than 250 e-commerce applications, online banking and the corporate sites came up with a statement that more than 85% of web applications are vulnerable to attacks.
